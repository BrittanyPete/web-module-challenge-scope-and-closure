/*Task 1: counterMaker()
  
  Study the code for counter1 and counter2, then answer the questions below.
  
  1. What is the difference between counter1 and counter2?
      the code essentially returns the same thing. The first one uses a closure and private variables though, and can only be accessed inside of that function. counter2 has a global variable that it accesses instead.

  2. Which of the two uses a closure? How can you tell?
      counter1 uses a closure. You can tell because there is a function (counter) inside of another function (counterMaker). The counter reaches out of itself and into the outer function to access count.

  3. In what scenario would the counter1 code be preferable? In what scenario would 
     counter2 be better?  
      If we have private variables that we need to keep track of, using counter1 would be better. That way we could have two items, and the counter would keep them separate. 
      counter2 would be good to use if we needed to create a global variable.

/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 2: inning() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the inning function below to do the following:
  1. Return a random whole number of points between 0 and 2 scored by one team in an inning
  
  For example: invoking inning() should return a numerical score value of 0, 1, or 2
  
NOTE: This will be a callback function for the tasks below

/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 3: finalScore() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the finalScore function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `inning` that was created in Task 2 
  2. Receive a number of innings to be played
  3. After each inning, update the score of the home and away teams
  4. After the last inning, return an object containing the final (total) score of the innings played
  
  For example: invoking finalScore(inning, 9) might return this object:
{
  "Home": 11,
  "Away": 5
}

  2. Return an object with a score for home and a score for away that populates from invoking the inning callback function */

/* ⚾️⚾️⚾️ Task 5: scoreboard() ⚾️⚾️⚾️
Use the scoreboard function below to do the following:
  1. Receive the callback function `getInningScore` from Task 4
  2. Receive the callback function `inning` from Task 2
  3. Receive a number of innings to be played
  4. Return an array where each of it's index values equals a string stating the
  Home and Away team's scores for each inning.  Not the cummulative score.
  5. If there's a tie at the end of the innings, add this message containing the score to the end of the array:  "This game will require extra innings: Away 12 - Home 12"  (see tie example below)
     If there isn't a tie, add this message to the end of the array: "Final Score: Away 13 - Home 11"  (see no tie example below)
  
  NO TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 1",
  "Inning 3: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 4: Away 2 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 5: Away 2 - Home 0", 
  "Inning 6: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 7: Away 0 - Home 2", 
  "Inning 8: Away 2 - Home 2",
  "Inning 9: Away 1 - Home 0", 
  "Final Score: Away 11 - Home 12"

  TIE example: invoking scoreboard(getInningScore,inning, 9) might return 
  an array of strings like this:
[
  "Inning 1: Away 1 - Home 1", 
  "Inning 2: Away 2 - Home 2",
