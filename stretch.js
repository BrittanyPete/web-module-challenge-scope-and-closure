// ### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

// After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

// See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

// 1. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).

// ```js
// var addSix = createBase(6);
// addSix(10); // returns 16
// addSix(21); // returns 27
// ```

// 2. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!
